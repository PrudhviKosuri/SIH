# Flutter Project Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter SDK (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Install Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions
3. Set up Android/iOS development environment

## Setup Steps

### 1. Initialize Flutter Project
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/prudhvi/Downloads/civic_issue_reporter_ui_ie3wpi_alphaproject

# Initialize Flutter project (if not already done)
flutter create . --org com.example.civic_issue_reporter

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Verify Project Structure
The project should have the following structure:
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                 # App entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ report.dart          # Report data model
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard_screen.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reports_screen.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ profile_screen.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ login_screen.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ header_widget.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bottom_nav_widget.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ status_bar_widget.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ report_item_widget.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ report_form_widget.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ recent_reports_widget.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app_theme.dart       # App theme and colors
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ mock_data.dart       # Sample data for development
```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
# Check for connected devices
flutter devices

# Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run

# Run in debug mode
flutter run --debug

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
```

### 4. Build the App
```bash
# Build APK for Android
flutter build apk

# Build iOS app (requires macOS and Xcode)
flutter build ios
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Flutter SDK not found**: Make sure Flutter is installed and added to PATH
2. **Dependencies issues**: Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. **Build errors**: Check that all required permissions are set in AndroidManifest.xml
4. **iOS build issues**: Ensure Xcode is installed and iOS development is set up

### Dependencies
- `flutter`: Flutter SDK
- `cupertino_icons`: iOS-style icons
- `http`: HTTP requests
- `image_picker`: Camera and gallery access
- `permission_handler`: Runtime permissions

## Project Architecture

The app follows Flutter best practices:
- **State Management**: Uses StatefulWidget for local state
- **Navigation**: Named routes with Navigator
- **Widget Composition**: Reusable widgets for consistent UI
- **Theme System**: Centralized theming with Material Design 3
- **Data Models**: Strongly typed models with enums
